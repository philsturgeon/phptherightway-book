From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection):

> Dependency injection is a software design pattern that allows the removal of hard-coded dependencies and makes it 
> possible to change them, whether at run-time or compile-time.

This quote makes the concept sound much more complicated than it actually is. Dependency Injection is providing a
component with its dependencies either through constructor injection, method calls or the setting of properties. It is
that simple.


## Basic Concept {#basic_concept_title}

We can demonstrate the concept with a simple, yet naive example.

Here we have a `Database` class that requires an adapter to speak to the database. We instantiate the adapter in the
constructor and create a hard dependency. This makes testing difficult and means the `Database` class is very tightly
coupled to the adapter.


{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~
<?php
namespace Database;

class Database
{
    protected $adapter;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->adapter = new MySqlAdapter;
    }
}

class MysqlAdapter {}
~~~~~~~~

This code can be refactored to use Dependency Injection and therefore loosen the dependency.


{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~
<?php
namespace Database;

class Database
{
    protected $adapter;

    public function __construct(MySqlAdapter $adapter)
    {
        $this->adapter = $adapter;
    }
}

class MysqlAdapter {}
~~~~~~~~

Now we are giving the `Database` class its dependency rather than it creating it itself. We could even create a method
that would accept an argument of the dependency and set it that way, or if the `$adapter` property was `public` we
could set it directly.


## Complex Problem {#complex_problem_title}

If you have ever read about Dependency Injection then you have probably seen the terms *"Inversion of Control"* or
*"Dependency Inversion Principle"*. These are the complex problems that Dependency Injection solves.

### Inversion of Control

Inversion of Control is as it says, "inverting the control" of a system by keeping organisational control entirely
separate from our objects. In terms of Dependency Injection, this means loosening our dependencies by controlling and
instantiating them elsewhere in the system.

For years, PHP frameworks have been achieving Inversion of Control, however, the question became, which part of control
are you inverting, and where to? For example, MVC frameworks would generally provide a super object or base controller
that other controllers must extend to gain access to its dependencies. This **is** Inversion of Control, however,
instead of loosening dependencies, this method simply moved them.

Dependency Injection allows us to more elegantly solve this problem by only injecting the dependencies we need, when we
need them, without the need for any hard coded dependencies at all.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

Dependency Inversion Principle is the "D" in the S.O.L.I.D set of object oriented design principles that states one
should *"Depend on Abstractions. Do not depend on concretions."*. Put simply, this means our dependencies should be
interfaces/contracts or abstract classes rather than concrete implementations. We can easily refactor the above example
to follow this principle.


{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~
<?php
namespace Database;

class Database
{
    protected $adapter;

    public function __construct(AdapterInterface $adapter)
    {
        $this->adapter = $adapter;
    }
}

interface AdapterInterface {}

class MysqlAdapter implements AdapterInterface {}
~~~~~~~~

There are several benefits to the `Database` class now depending on an interface rather than a concretion.

Consider that you are working in a team and the adapter is being worked on by a colleague. In our first example, we
would have to wait for said colleague to finish the adapter before we could properly mock it for our unit tests. Now
that the dependency is an interface/contract we can happily mock that interface knowing that our colleague will build
the adapter based on that contract.

An even bigger benefit to this method is that our code is now much more scalable. If a year down the line we decide
that we want to migrate to a different type of database, we can write an adapter that implements the original interface
and inject that instead, no more refactoring would be required as we can ensure that the adapter follows the contract
set by the interface.


## Containers {#containers_title}

The first thing you should understand about Dependency Injection Containers is that they are not the same thing as
Dependency Injection. A container is a convenience utility that helps us implement Dependency Injection, however, they
can be and often are misused to implement an anti-pattern, Service Location. Injecting a DI container as a Service
Locator in to your classes arguably creates a harder dependency on the container than the dependency you are replacing.
It also makes your code much less transparent and ultimately harder to test.

Most modern frameworks have their own Dependency Injection Container that allows you to wire your dependencies together
through configuration. What this means in practice is that you can write application code that is as clean and de-
coupled as the framework it is built on.
