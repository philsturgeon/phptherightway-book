# Virtualization

Running your application on different environments in development and production can lead to strange bugs popping up
when you go live. It's also tricky to keep different development environments up to date with the same version for all
libraries used when working with a team of developers.

If you are developing on Windows and deploying to Linux (or anything non-Windows) or are developing in a team, you
should consider using a virtual machine. This sounds tricky, but besides the widely known virtualization environments
like VMware or VirtualBox, there are additional tools that may help you setting up a virtual environment in a few easy
steps.


## Vagrant {#vagrant_title}

[Vagrant] helps you build your virtual boxes on top of the known virtual environments and will configure these
environments based on a single configuration file. These boxes can be set up manually, or you can use "provisioning"
software such as [Puppet] or [Chef] to do this for you. Provisioning the base box is a great way to ensure that
multiple boxes are set up in an identical fashion and removes the need for you to maintain complicated "set up"
command lists. You can also "destroy" your base box and recreate it without many manual steps, making it easy to create
a "fresh" installation.

Vagrant creates folders for sharing your code between your host and your virtual machine, which means that you can
create and edit your files on your host machine and then run the code inside your virtual machine.

### A little help

If you need a little help to start using Vagrant there are some services that might be useful:

- [Rove][Rove]: service that allows you to pre-generate typical Vagrant builds, PHP among the options. The provisioning is
made with Chef.
- [Puphpet][Puphpet]: simple GUI to set up virtual machines for PHP development. **Heavily focused in PHP**. Besides local VMs,
it can be used to deploy to cloud services as well. The provisioning is made with Puppet.
- [Protobox][Protobox]: is a layer on top of vagrant and a web GUI to setup virtual machines for web development. A single YAML
document controls everything that is installed on the virtual machine.
- [Phansible][Phansible]: provides an easy to use interface that helps you generate Ansible Playbooks for PHP based projects.

## Docker {#docker_title}

Beside using Vagrant, another easy way to get a virtual development or production environment up and running is [Docker].
Docker helps you to provide Linux containers for all kind of applications. 
There are many helpful docker images which could provide you with other great services without the need to install
these services on your local machine, e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL and a lot more. Have a look at the [Docker Hub Registry]
[docker-hub] to search a list of available pre-built containers, which you can then run and use in very few steps.

### Example: Runnning your PHP Applications in Docker

After you [installed docker][docker-install] on your machine, you can start an Apache with PHP support in one step.
The following command will download a fully functional Apache installation with the latest PHP version and provide the
directory `/path/to/your/php/files` at `http://localhost:8080`:


{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
docker run -d --name my-php-webserver -p 8080:80 -v /path/to/your/php/files:/var/www/html/ php:apache
~~~~~~~~

After running `docker run` your container is initialized and running.
If you would like to stop or start your container again, you can use the provided name attribute and simply run
`docker stop my-php-webserver` and `docker start my-php-webserver` without providing the above mentioned parameters
again.

### Learn more about Docker

The commands mentioned above only show a quick way to run an Apache web server with PHP support but there are a lot
more things that you can do with Docker. One of the most important things for PHP developers will be linking your
web server to a database instance, for example. How this could be done is well described within the [Docker User Guide]
[docker-doc].
