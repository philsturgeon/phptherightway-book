Running your application on different environments in development and production can lead to strange bugs popping up
when you go live. It's also tricky to keep different development environments up to date with the same version for all
libraries used when working with a team of developers.

If you are developing on Windows and deploying to Linux (or anything non-Windows) or are developing in a team, you
should consider using a virtual machine. This sounds tricky, but besides the widely known virtualization environments
like VMware or VirtualBox, there are additional tools that may help you setting up a virtual environment in a few easy
steps.


## Vagrant {#vagrant_title}

[Vagrant] helps you build your virtual boxes on top of the known virtual environments and will configure these
environments based on a single configuration file. These boxes can be set up manually, or you can use "provisioning"
software such as [Puppet] or [Chef] to do this for you. Provisioning the base box is a great way to ensure that
multiple boxes are set up in an identical fashion and removes the need for you to maintain complicated "set up"
command lists. You can also "destroy" your base box and recreate it without many manual steps, making it easy to create
a "fresh" installation.

Vagrant creates folders for sharing your code between your host and your virtual machine, which means that you can
create and edit your files on your host machine and then run the code inside your virtual machine.

### A little help

If you need a little help to start using Vagrant there are some services that might be useful:

- [Rove][Rove]: service that allows you to pre-generate typical Vagrant builds, PHP among the options. The provisioning is
made with Chef.
- [Puphpet][Puphpet]: simple GUI to set up virtual machines for PHP development. **Heavily focused in PHP**. Besides local VMs,
it can be used to deploy to cloud services as well. The provisioning is made with Puppet.
- [Protobox][Protobox]: is a layer on top of vagrant and a web GUI to setup virtual machines for web development. A single YAML
document controls everything that is installed on the virtual machine.
- [Phansible][Phansible]: provides an easy to use interface that helps you generate Ansible Playbooks for PHP based projects.

## Docker {#docker_title}

[Docker] - a lightweight alternative to a full virtual machine - is so called because it's all about "containers".  A container is a building block which, in the simplest case, does one specific job, e.g. running a web server.  An "image" is the package you use to build the container - Docker has a repository full of them.

A typical LAMP application might have three containers: a web server, a PHP-FPM process and MySQL. As with shared folders in Vagrant, you can leave your application files where they are and tell Docker where to find them.

You can generate containers from the command line (see example below) or, for ease of maintenance, build a `docker-compose.yml` file for your project specifying which to create and how they communicate with one another.

Docker may help if you're developing multiple websites and want the separation that comes from installing each on it's own virtual machine, but don't have the necessary disk space or the time to keep everything up to date.  It's efficient: the installation and downloads are quicker, you only need to store one copy of each image however often it's used, containers need less RAM and share the same OS kernel, so you can have more servers running simultaneously, and it takes a matter of seconds to stop and start them, no need to wait for a full server boot. 

### Example: Running your PHP Applications in Docker

After [installing docker][docker-install] on your machine, you can start a web server with one command.
The following will download a fully functional Apache installation with the latest PHP version, map `/path/to/your/php/files` to the document root, which you can view at `http://localhost:8080`:


{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
docker run -d --name my-php-webserver -p 8080:80 -v /path/to/your/php/files:/var/www/html/ php:apache
~~~~~~~~

This will initialize and launch your container. `-d` makes it runs in the background. To stop and start it, simply run `docker stop my-php-webserver` and `docker start my-php-webserver` (the other parameters are not needed again).

### Learn more about Docker

The command above shows a quick way to run a basic server.  There's much more you can do (and thousands of pre-built images in the [Docker Hub][docker-hub]). Take time to learn the terminology and read the [Docker User Guide][docker-doc] to get the most from it, and don't run random code you've downloaded without checking it's safe – unofficial images may not have the latest security patches. If in doubt, stick to the [official repositiories][docker-hub-official].

The [PHPDocker.io] site will auto-generate all the files you need for a fully-featured LAMP/LEMP stack, including your choice of PHP version and extensions.
