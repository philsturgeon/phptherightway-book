## Data Filtering {#data_filtering_title}

Never ever (ever) trust foreign input introduced to your PHP code. Always sanitize and validate foreign input before
using it in code. The `filter_var()` and `filter_input()` functions can sanitize text and validate text formats (e.g.
email addresses).

Foreign input can be anything: `$_GET` and `$_POST` form input data, some values in the `$_SERVER` superglobal, and the
HTTP request body via `fopen('php://input', 'r')`. Remember, foreign input is not limited to form data submitted by the
user. Uploaded and downloaded files, session values, cookie data, and data from third-party web services are foreign
input, too.

While foreign data can be stored, combined, and accessed later, it is still foreign input. Every time you process,
output, concatenate, or include data in your code, ask yourself if the data is filtered properly and can it be trusted.

Data may be _filtered_ differently based on its purpose. For example, when unfiltered foreign input is passed into HTML
page output, it can execute HTML and JavaScript on your site! This is known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and can be a
very dangerous attack. One way to avoid XSS is to sanitize all user-generated data before outputting it to your page by
removing HTML tags with the `strip_tags()` function or escaping characters with special meaning into their respective
HTML entities with the `htmlentities()` or `htmlspecialchars()` functions.

Another example is passing options to be executed on the command line. This can be extremely dangerous (and is usually
a bad idea), but you can use the built-in `escapeshellarg()` function to sanitize the executed command's arguments.

One last example is accepting foreign input to determine a file to load from the filesystem. This can be exploited by
changing the filename to a file path. You need to remove `"/"`, `"../"`, [null bytes][6], or other characters from the
file path so it can't load hidden, non-public, or sensitive files.

### Sanitization

Sanitization removes (or escapes) illegal or unsafe characters from foreign input.

For example, you should sanitize foreign input before including the input in HTML or inserting it into a raw SQL query.
When you use bound parameters with [PDO](#databases), it will sanitize the input for you.

Sometimes it is required to allow some safe HTML tags in the input when including it in the HTML page. This is very
hard to do and many avoid it by using other more restricted formatting like Markdown or BBCode, although whitelisting
libraries like [HTML Purifier][html-purifier] exists for this reason.

[See Sanitization Filters][2]

### Unserialization

It is dangerous to `unserialize()` data from users or other untrusted sources.  Doing so can allow malicious users to instantiate objects (with user-defined properties) whose destructors will be executed, **even if the objects themselves aren't used**.  You should therefore avoid unserializing untrusted data.

If you absolutely must unserialize data from untrusted sources, use PHP 7's [`allowed_classes`][unserialize] option to restrict which object types are allowed to be unserialized.

### Validation

Validation ensures that foreign input is what you expect. For example, you may want to validate an email address, a
phone number, or age when processing a registration submission.

## Web Application Security {#web_application_security_title}

It is very important for every PHP developer to learn [the basics of web application security][4], which can be broken
down into a handful of broad topics:

1. Code-data separation.
   * When data is executed as code, you get SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Local/Remote File Inclusion, etc.
   * When code is printed as data, you get information leaks (source code disclosure or, in the case of C programs,
     enough information to bypass [ASLR][5]).
2. Application logic.
   * Missing authentication or authorization controls.
   * Input validation.
3. Operating environment.
   * PHP versions.
   * Third party libraries.
   * The operating system.
4. Cryptography weaknesses.
   * [Weak random numbers][6].
   * [Chosen-ciphertext attacks][7].
   * [Side-channel information leaks][8].

There are bad people ready and willing to exploit your web application. It is important that you take necessary
precautions to harden your web application's security. Luckily, the fine folks at
[The Open Web Application Security Project][1] (OWASP) have compiled a comprehensive list of known security issues and
methods to protect yourself against them. This is a must read for the security-conscious developer. [Survive The Deep End: PHP Security][3] by Padraic Brady is also another good web application security guide for PHP.

## Error Reporting {#error_reporting_title}

Error logging can be useful in finding the problem spots in your application, but it can also expose information about
the structure of your application to the outside world. To effectively protect your application from issues that could
be caused by the output of these messages, you need to configure your server differently in development versus
production (live).

### Development

To show every possible error during **development**, configure the following settings in your `php.ini`:


{lang="ini"}
~~~~~~~~
display_errors = On
display_startup_errors = On
error_reporting = -1
log_errors = On
~~~~~~~~

> Passing in the value `-1` will show every possible error, even when new levels and constants are added in future PHP
> versions. The `E_ALL` constant also behaves this way as of PHP 5.4. -
> [php.net](https://secure.php.net/function.error-reporting)

The `E_STRICT` error level constant was introduced in 5.3.0 and is not part of `E_ALL`, however it became part of
`E_ALL` in 5.4.0. What does this mean? In terms of reporting every possible error in version 5.3 it means you must
use either `-1` or `E_ALL | E_STRICT`.

**Reporting every possible error by PHP version**

* &lt; 5.3 `-1` or `E_ALL`
* &nbsp; 5.3 `-1` or `E_ALL | E_STRICT`
* &gt; 5.3 `-1` or `E_ALL`

### Production

To hide errors on your **production** environment, configure your `php.ini` as:


{lang="ini"}
~~~~~~~~
display_errors = Off
display_startup_errors = Off
error_reporting = E_ALL
log_errors = On
~~~~~~~~

With these settings in production, errors will still be logged to the error logs for the web server, but will not be
shown to the user. For more information on these settings, see the PHP manual:

* [error_reporting](https://secure.php.net/errorfunc.configuration#ini.error-reporting)
* [display_errors](https://secure.php.net/errorfunc.configuration#ini.display-errors)
* [display_startup_errors](https://secure.php.net/errorfunc.configuration#ini.display-startup-errors)
* [log_errors](https://secure.php.net/errorfunc.configuration#ini.log-errors)


## Configuration Files {#configuration_files_title}

When creating configuration files for your applications, best practices recommend that one of the following methods be
followed:

- It is recommended that you store your configuration information where it cannot be accessed directly and pulled in
via the file system.
- If you must store your configuration files in the document root, name the files with a `.php` extension. This ensures
that, even if the script is accessed directly, it will not be output as plain text.
- Information in configuration files should be protected accordingly, either through encryption or group/user file
system permissions.
- It is a good idea to ensure that you do not commit configuration files containing sensitive information e.g. passwords or API tokens to source control.


## Register Globals {#register_globals_title}

**NOTE:** As of PHP 5.4.0 the `register_globals` setting has been removed and can no longer be used. This is only
included as a warning for anyone in the process of upgrading a legacy application.

When enabled, the `register_globals` configuration setting makes several types of variables (including ones from
`$_POST`, `$_GET` and `$_REQUEST`) available in the global scope of your application. This can easily lead to security
issues as your application cannot effectively tell where the data is coming from.

For example: `$_GET['foo']` would be available via `$foo`, which can override variables that have been declared.

If you are using PHP < 5.4.0 __make sure__ that `register_globals` is __off__.

[Paragon Initiative](https://paragonie.com/).


## Password Hashing {#password_hashing_title}

Eventually everyone builds a PHP application that relies on user login. Usernames and passwords are stored in a
database and later used to authenticate users upon login.

It is important that you properly [_hash_][3] passwords before storing them. Hashing and encrypting are [two very different things][7]
that often get confused.

Hashing is an irreversible, one-way function. This produces a fixed-length string that cannot be feasibly reversed.
This means you can compare a hash against another to determine if they both came from the same source string, but you
cannot determine the original string. If passwords are not hashed and your database is accessed by an unauthorized
third-party, all user accounts are now compromised.

Unlike hashing, encryption is reversible (provided you have the key). Encryption is useful in other areas, but is a poor
strategy for securely storing passwords.

Passwords should also be individually [_salted_][5] by adding a random string to each password before hashing. This prevents dictionary attacks and the use of "rainbow tables" (a reverse list of crytographic hashes for common passwords.)

Hashing and salting are vital as often users use the same password for multiple services and password quality can be poor.

Additionally, you should use [a specialized _password hashing_ algorithm][6] rather than fast, general-purpose
cryptographic hash function (e.g. SHA256). The short list of acceptable password hashing algorithms (as of June 2018)
to use are:

* Argon2 (available in PHP 7.2 and newer)
* Scrypt
* **Bcrypt** (PHP provides this one for you; see below)
* PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256 or HMAC-SHA512

Fortunately, nowadays PHP makes this easy.

**Hashing passwords with `password_hash`**

In PHP 5.5 `password_hash()` was introduced. At this time it is using BCrypt, the strongest algorithm currently
supported by PHP. It will be updated in the future to support more algorithms as needed though. The `password_compat`
library was created to provide forward compatibility for PHP >= 5.3.7.

Below we hash a string, and then check the hash against a new string. Because our two source strings are different
('secret-password' vs. 'bad-password') this login will fail.


{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~
<?php
require 'password.php';

$passwordHash = password_hash('secret-password', PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

if (password_verify('bad-password', $passwordHash)) {
    // Correct Password
} else {
    // Wrong password
}
~~~~~~~~

`password_hash()` takes care of password salting for you. The salt is stored, along with the algorithm and "cost", as part of the hash.  `password_verify()` extracts this to determine how to check the password, so you don't need a separate database field to store your salts.
