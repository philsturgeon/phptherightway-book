## Windows Setup {#windows_setup_title}

You can download the binaries from [windows.php.net/download][php-downloads]. After the extraction of PHP, it is recommended to set the [PATH][windows-path] to the root of your PHP folder (where php.exe is located) so you can execute PHP from anywhere.

For learning and local development, you can use the built in webserver with PHP 5.4+ so you don't need to worry about
configuring it. If you would like an "all-in-one" which includes a full-blown webserver and MySQL too then tools such
as the [XAMPP][xampp], [EasyPHP][easyphp], [OpenServer][openserver] and [WAMP][wamp] will
help get a Windows development environment up and running fast. That said, these tools will be a little different from
production so be careful of environment differences if you are working on Windows and deploying to Linux.

If you need to run your production system on Windows, then IIS7 will give you the most stable and best performance. You
can use [phpmanager][phpmanager] (a GUI plugin for IIS7) to make configuring and managing PHP simple. IIS7 comes with
FastCGI built in and ready to go, you just need to configure PHP as a handler. For support and additional resources
there is a [dedicated area on iis.net][php-iis] for PHP.

Generally running your application on different environment in development and production can lead to strange bugs popping up when you go
live. If you are developing on Windows and deploying to Linux (or anything non-Windows) then you should consider using a [Virtual Machine](/#virtualization_title).

Chris Tankersley has a very helpful blog post on what tools he uses to do [PHP development using Windows][windows-tools].

## Mac Setup {#mac_setup_title}

macOS comes prepackaged with PHP but it is normally a little behind the latest stable release. There are multiple ways to install the latest PHP version on macOS.

### Install PHP via Homebrew

[Homebrew] is a package manager for macOS that helps you easily install PHP and various extensions. The Homebrew core repository provides "formulae" for PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0 and PHP 8.1. Install the latest version with this command:

```
brew install php@8.1
```

You can switch between Homebrew PHP versions by modifying your `PATH` variable. Alternatively, you can use [brew-php-switcher][brew-php-switcher] to switch PHP versions automatically.

You can also switch between PHP versions manually by unlinking and linking the wanted version:

```
brew unlink php
brew link --overwrite php@8.0
```

```
brew unlink php
brew link --overwrite php@8.1
```

### Install PHP via Macports

The [MacPorts] Project is an open-source community initiative to design an
easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading either
command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the OS X operating
system.

MacPorts supports pre-compiled binaries, so you don't need to recompile every
dependency from the source tarball files, it saves your life if you don't
have any package installed on your system.

At this point, you can install `php54`, `php55`, `php56`, `php70`, `php71`, `php72`, `php73`, `php74`, `php80` or `php81` using the `port install` command, for example:

    sudo port install php74
    sudo port install php81

And you can run `select` command to switch your active PHP:

    sudo port select --set php php81

### Install PHP via phpbrew

[phpbrew] is a tool for installing and managing multiple PHP versions. This can be really useful if two different
applications/projects require different versions of PHP, and you are not using virtual machines.

### Install PHP via Liip's binary installer

Another popular option is [php-osx.liip.ch] which provides one liner installation methods for versions 5.3 through 7.3.
It doesn't overwrite the PHP binaries installed by Apple, but installs everything in a separate location (/usr/local/php5).

### Compile from Source

Another option that gives you control over the version of PHP you install, is to [compile it yourself][mac-compile].
In that case be sure to have installed either [Xcode][xcode-gcc-substitution] or Apple's substitute
["Command Line Tools for XCode"] downloadable from Apple's Mac Developer Center.

### All-in-One Installers

The solutions listed above mainly handle PHP itself, and do not supply things like [Apache][apache], [Nginx][nginx] or a SQL server.
"All-in-one" solutions such as [MAMP][mamp-downloads] and [XAMPP][xampp] will install these other bits of software for
you and tie them all together, but ease of setup comes with a trade-off of flexibility.

## Common Directory structure {#common_directory_structure_title}

A common question among those starting out with writing programs for the web is, "where do I put my stuff?" Over the years, this answer has consistently been "where the `DocumentRoot` is." Although this answer is not complete, it's a great place to start.

For security reasons, configuration files should not be accessible by a site's visitors; therefore, public scripts are kept in a public directory and private configurations and data are kept outside of that directory.

For each team, CMS, or framework one works in, a standard directory structure is used by each of those entities. However, if one is starting a project alone, knowing which filesystem structure to use can be daunting.

[Paul M. Jones] has done some fantastic research into common practices of tens of thousands of github projects in the realm of PHP. He has compiled a standard file and directory structure, the [Standard PHP Package Skeleton], based on this research. In this directory structure, `DocumentRoot` should point to `public/`, unit tests should be in the `tests/` directory, and third party libraries, as installed by [composer], belong in the `vendor/` directory. For other files and directories, abiding by the [Standard PHP Package Skeleton] will make the most sense to contributors of a project.

# Getting Started {#getting_started_title}



## Use the Current Stable Version (8.1) {#use_the_current_stable_version_title}

If you are getting started with PHP, start with the current stable release of [PHP 8.1][php-release]. PHP 8.x adds many [new features](#language_highlights) over the older 7.x and 5.x versions. The engine has been largely re-written, and PHP is now even quicker than older versions. PHP 8 is a major update of the language and contains many new features and optimizations.

You should try to upgrade to the latest stable version quickly - PHP 5.6 [is already End of Life](http://php.net/supported-versions.php). Upgrading is easy, as there are not many [backwards compatibility breaks][php-bc]. If you are not sure which version a function or feature is in, you can check the PHP documentation on the [php.net][php-docs] website.

## Built-in web server {#builtin_web_server_title}

With PHP 5.4 or newer, you can start learning PHP without installing and configuring a full-fledged web server.
To start the server, run the following command from your terminal in your project's web root:


{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
> php -S localhost:8000
~~~~~~~~
