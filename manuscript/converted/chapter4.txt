There are a ton of PHP libraries, frameworks, and components to choose from. Your project will likely use 
several of them — these are project dependencies. Until recently, PHP did not have a good way to manage
these project dependencies. Even if you managed them manually, you still had to worry about autoloaders.
That is no longer an issue.

Currently there are two major package management systems for PHP - [Composer] and [PEAR]. Composer is
the main package manager to use for PHP, however for a long time PEAR used to fill that role. Knowing what
PEAR is will be a good idea as you may still find references to it, even if you never use it.

## Composer and Packagist {#composer_and_packagist_title}

Composer is a **brilliant** dependency manager for PHP. List your project's dependencies in a `composer.json` file and,
with a few simple commands, Composer will automatically download your project's dependencies and setup autoloading for
you.

There are already a lot of PHP libraries that are compatible with Composer, ready to be used in your project. These
"packages" are listed on [Packagist], the official repository for Composer-compatible PHP libraries.

### How to Install Composer

You can install Composer locally (in your current working directory; though this is no longer recommended) or globally
(e.g. /usr/local/bin). Let's assume you want to install Composer locally. From your project's root directory:


{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
~~~~~~~~

This will download `composer.phar` (a PHP binary archive). You can run this with `php` to manage your project
dependencies.
<strong>Please Note:</strong> If you pipe downloaded code directly into an interpreter, please read the
code online first to confirm it is safe.

#### Installing on Windows

For Windows users the easiest way to get up and running is to use the [ComposerSetup] installer, which
performs a global install and sets up your `$PATH` so that you can just call `composer` from any
directory in your command line.

### How to Install Composer (manually)

Manually installing Composer is an advanced technique; however, there are various reasons why a 
developer might prefer this method vs. using the interactive installation routine. The interactive
installation checks your PHP installation to ensure that:

- a sufficient version of PHP is being used
- `.phar` files can be executed correctly
- certain directory permissions are sufficient
- certain problematic extensions are not loaded
- certain `php.ini` settings are set

Since a manual installation performs none of these checks, you have to decide whether the trade-off is 
worth it for you. As such, below is how to obtain Composer manually:


{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar -o $HOME/local/bin/composer
chmod +x $HOME/local/bin/composer
~~~~~~~~

The path `$HOME/local/bin` (or a directory of your choice) should be in your `$PATH` environment 
variable. This will result in a `composer` command being available.

When you come across documentation that states to run Composer as `php composer.phar install`, you can
substitute that with:


{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
composer install
~~~~~~~~

This section will assume you have installed composer globally.

### How to Define and Install Dependencies

Composer keeps track of your project's dependencies in a file called `composer.json`. You can manage it
by hand if you like, or use Composer itself. The `composer require` command adds a project dependency 
and if you don't have a `composer.json` file, one will be created. Here's an example that adds [Twig]
as a dependency of your project.


{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
composer require twig/twig:~1.8
~~~~~~~~

Alternatively the `composer init` command will guide you through creating a full `composer.json` file
for your project. Either way, once you've created your `composer.json` file you can tell Composer to
download and install your dependencies into the `vendor/` directory. This also applies to projects 
you've downloaded that already provide a `composer.json` file:


{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
composer install
~~~~~~~~

Next, add this line to your application's primary PHP file; this will tell PHP to use Composer's 
autoloader for your project dependencies.


{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
~~~~~~~~

Now you can use your project dependencies, and they'll be autoloaded on demand.

### Updating your dependencies

Composer creates a file called `composer.lock` which stores the exact version of each package it
downloaded when you
first ran `composer install`. If you share your project with other coders and the `composer.lock` file
is part of your distribution, when they run `composer install` they'll get the same versions as you. 
To update your dependencies, run `composer update`.

This is most useful when you define your version requirements flexibly. For instance a version 
requirement of `~1.8` means "anything newer than `1.8.0`, but less than `2.0.x-dev`". You can also use 
the `*` wildcard as in `1.8.*`. Now Composer's `composer update` command will upgrade all your
dependencies to the newest version that fits the restrictions you define.

### Update Notifications

To receive notifications about new version releases you can sign up for [VersionEye], a web service
that can monitor your GitHub and BitBucket accounts for `composer.json` files and send emails with new
package releases.

### Checking your dependencies for security issues

The [Security Advisories Checker] is a web service and a command-line tool, both will examine your `composer.lock`
file and tell you if you need to update any of your dependencies.

### Handling global dependencies with Composer

Composer can also handle global dependencies and their binaries. Usage is straight-forward, all you need
to do is prefix your command with `global`. If per example you wanted to install PHPUnit and have it 
available globally, you'd run the following command:


{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
composer global require phpunit/phpunit
~~~~~~~~

This will create a `~/.composer` folder where your global dependencies reside. To have the installed
packages' binaries available everywhere, you'd then add the `~/.composer/vendor/bin` folder to your 
`$PATH` variable.

## PEAR {#pear_title}

A veteran package manager that some PHP developers enjoy is [PEAR][1]. It behaves similarly to Composer,
but has some notable differences.

PEAR requires each package to have a specific structure, which means that the author of the package must prepare it for
usage with PEAR. Using a project which was not prepared to work with PEAR is not possible.

PEAR installs packages globally, which means after installing them once they are available to all projects on that
server. This can be good if many projects rely on the same package with the same version but might lead to problems if
version conflicts between two projects arise.

### How to install PEAR

You can install PEAR by downloading the `.phar` installer and executing it. The PEAR documentation has 
detailed [install instructions][2] for every operating system.

If you are using Linux, you can also have a look at your distribution package manager. Debian and Ubuntu, 
for example, have an apt `php-pear` package.

### How to install a package

If the package is listed on the [PEAR packages list][3], you can install it by specifying the official name:


{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
pear install foo
~~~~~~~~

If the package is hosted on another channel, you need to `discover` the channel first and also specify it when
installing. See the [Using channel docs][4] for more information on this topic.

### Handling PEAR dependencies with Composer

If you are already using [Composer][5] and you would like to install some PEAR code too, you can use Composer to
handle your PEAR dependencies. This example will install code from `pear2.php.net`:


{lang="json"}
~~~~~~~~
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "pear",
            "url": "http://pear2.php.net"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "pear-pear2/PEAR2_Text_Markdown": "*",
        "pear-pear2/PEAR2_HTTP_Request": "*"
    }
}
~~~~~~~~

The first section `"repositories"` will be used to let Composer know it should "initialize" (or "discover" in PEAR
terminology) the pear repo. Then the require section will prefix the package name like this:

> pear-channel/Package

The "pear" prefix is hardcoded to avoid any conflicts, as a pear channel could be the same as another packages vendor
name for example, then the channel short name (or full URL) can be used to reference which channel the package is in.

When this code is installed it will be available in your vendor directory and automatically available through the
Composer autoloader:

> vendor/pear-pear2.php.net/PEAR2_HTTP_Request/pear2/HTTP/Request.php

To use this PEAR package simply reference it like so:


{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~
<?php
$request = new pear2\HTTP\Request();
~~~~~~~~
