# Servers and Deployment {#servers_and_deployment_title}

PHP applications can be deployed and run on production web servers in a number of ways.


## Platform as a Service (PaaS) {#platform_as_a_service_title}

PaaS provides the system and network architecture necessary to run PHP applications on the web. This means little to no
configuration for launching PHP applications or PHP frameworks.

Recently PaaS has become a popular method for deploying, hosting, and scaling PHP applications of all sizes. You can
find a list of [PHP PaaS "Platform as a Service" providers](#php_paas_providers) in our [resources section](#resources).

## Virtual or Dedicated Servers {#virtual_or_dedicated_servers_title}

If you are comfortable with systems administration, or are interested in learning it, virtual or dedicated servers give
you complete control of your application's production environment.

### nginx and PHP-FPM

PHP, via PHP's built-in FastCGI Process Manager (FPM), pairs really nicely with [nginx], which is a lightweight,
high-performance web server. It uses less memory than Apache and can better handle more concurrent requests. This is
especially important on virtual servers that don't have much memory to spare.

### Apache and PHP

PHP and Apache have a long history together. Apache is wildly configurable and has many available 
[modules][apache-modules] to extend functionality. It is a popular choice for shared servers and an easy setup for PHP
frameworks and open source apps like WordPress. Unfortunately, Apache uses more resources than nginx by default and
cannot handle as many visitors at the same time.

Apache has several possible configurations for running PHP. The most common and easiest to setup is the [prefork MPM]
with mod_php5. While it isn't the most memory efficient, it is the simplest to get working and to use. This is probably
the best choice if you don't want to dig too deeply into the server administration aspects. Note that if you use
mod_php5 you MUST use the prefork MPM.

Alternatively, if you want to squeeze more performance and stability out of Apache then you can take advantage of the
same FPM system as nginx and run the [worker MPM] or [event MPM] with mod_fastcgi or mod_fcgid. This configuration will
be significantly more memory efficient and much faster but it is more work to set up.

## Shared Servers {#shared_servers_title}

PHP has shared servers to thank for its popularity. It is hard to find a host without PHP installed, but be sure it's
the latest version. Shared servers allow you and other developers to deploy websites to a single machine. The upside to
this is that it has become a cheap commodity. The downside is that you never know what kind of a ruckus your
neighboring tenants are going to create; loading down the server or opening up security holes are the main concerns. If
your project's budget can afford to avoid shared servers you should.


## Building and Deploying your Application {#building_and_deploying_your_application_title}

If you find yourself doing manual database schema changes or running your tests manually before updating your files
(manually), think twice! With every additional manual task needed to deploy a new version of your app, the chances for
potentially fatal mistakes increase. Whether you're dealing with a simple update, a comprehensive build process or even
a continuous integration strategy, [build automation][buildautomation] is your friend.

Among the tasks you might want to automate are:

* Dependency management
* Compilation, minification of your assets
* Running tests
* Creation of documentation
* Packaging
* Deployment


### Build Automation Tools

Build tools can be described as a collection of scripts that handle common tasks of software deployment. The build tool
is not a part of your software, it acts on your software from 'outside'.

There are many open source tools available to help you with build automation, some are written in PHP others aren't.
This shouldn't hold you back from using them, if they're better suited for the specific job. Here are a few examples:

[Phing] is the easiest way to get started with automated deployment in the PHP world. With Phing you can control your
packaging, deployment or testing process from within a simple XML build file. Phing (which is based on [Apache Ant])
provides a rich set of tasks usually needed to install or update a web app and can be extended with additional custom
tasks, written in PHP.

[Capistrano] is a system for *intermediate-to-advanced programmers* to execute commands in a structured, repeatable way
on one or more remote machines. It is pre-configured for deploying Ruby on Rails applications, however people are **
successfully deploying PHP systems** with it. Successful use of Capistrano depends on a working knowledge of Ruby and
Rake.

Dave Gardner's blog post [PHP Deployment with Capistrano][phpdeploy_capistrano] is a good starting point for PHP
developers interested in Capistrano.

[Chef] is more than a deployment framework, it is a very powerful Ruby based system integration framework that doesn't
just deploy your app but can build your whole server environment or virtual boxes.

[Deployer] is a deployment tool written in PHP, it's simple and functional. Deploy your code to all servers you want, it supports deploy via copy, or via VCS (like git), or via rsync. Run your tasks on all your servers, or use our recipes of common tasks for Symfony, Laravel, Zend Framework and Yii.

### Continuous Integration

> Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently,
> usually each person integrates at least daily — leading to multiple integrations per day. Many teams find that this
> approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more
> rapidly.

*-- Martin Fowler*

There are different ways to implement continuous integration for PHP. Recently [Travis CI] has done a great job of
making continuous integration a reality even for small projects. Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration service
for the open source community. It is integrated with GitHub and offers first class support for many languages including
PHP.
