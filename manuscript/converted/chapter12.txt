## Virtual or Dedicated Servers {#virtual_or_dedicated_servers_title}

If you are comfortable with systems administration, or are interested in learning it, virtual or dedicated servers give
you complete control of your application's production environment.

### nginx and PHP-FPM

PHP, via PHP's built-in FastCGI Process Manager (FPM), pairs really nicely with [nginx], which is a lightweight,
high-performance web server. It uses less memory than Apache and can better handle more concurrent requests. This is
especially important on virtual servers that don't have much memory to spare.

### Apache and PHP

PHP and Apache have a long history together. Apache is wildly configurable and has many available
[modules][apache-modules] to extend functionality. It is a popular choice for shared servers and an easy setup for PHP
frameworks and open source apps like WordPress. Unfortunately, Apache uses more resources than nginx by default and
cannot handle as many visitors at the same time.

Apache has several possible configurations for running PHP. The most common and easiest to setup is the [prefork MPM]
with mod_php5. While it isn't the most memory efficient, it is the simplest to get working and to use. This is probably
the best choice if you don't want to dig too deeply into the server administration aspects. Note that if you use
mod_php5 you MUST use the prefork MPM.

Alternatively, if you want to squeeze more performance and stability out of Apache then you can take advantage of the
same FPM system as nginx and run the [worker MPM] or [event MPM] with mod_fastcgi or mod_fcgid. This configuration will
be significantly more memory efficient and much faster but it is more work to set up.

If you are running Apache 2.4 or later, you can use [mod_proxy_fcgi] to get great performance that is easy to setup.

## Shared Servers {#shared_servers_title}

PHP has shared servers to thank for its popularity. It is hard to find a host without PHP installed, but be sure it's
the latest version. Shared servers allow you and other developers to deploy websites to a single machine. The upside to
this is that it has become a cheap commodity. The downside is that you never know what kind of a ruckus your
neighboring tenants are going to create; loading down the server or opening up security holes are the main concerns. If
your project's budget can afford to avoid shared servers, you should.

To make sure your shared servers are offering the latest versions of PHP, check out [PHP Versions](http://phpversions.info/shared-hosting/).


# Servers and Deployment {#servers_and_deployment_title}

PHP applications can be deployed and run on production web servers in a number of ways.


## Platform as a Service (PaaS) {#platform_as_a_service_title}

PaaS provides the system and network architecture necessary to run PHP applications on the web. This means little to no
configuration for launching PHP applications or PHP frameworks.

Recently PaaS has become a popular method for deploying, hosting, and scaling PHP applications of all sizes. You can
find a list of [PHP PaaS "Platform as a Service" providers](#php_paas_providers) in our [resources section](#resources).

## Building and Deploying your Application {#building_and_deploying_your_application_title}

If you find yourself doing manual database schema changes or running your tests manually before updating your files
(manually), think twice! With every additional manual task needed to deploy a new version of your app, the chances for
potentially fatal mistakes increase. Whether you're dealing with a simple update, a comprehensive build process or even
a continuous integration strategy, [build automation][buildautomation] is your friend.

Among the tasks you might want to automate are:

* Dependency management
* Compilation, minification of your assets
* Running tests
* Creation of documentation
* Packaging
* Deployment


### Deployment Tools

Deployment tools can be described as a collection of scripts that handle common tasks of software deployment. The deployment tool is not a part of your software, it acts on your software from 'outside'.

There are many open source tools available to help you with build automation and deployment, some are written in PHP others aren't. This shouldn't hold you back from using them, if they're better suited for the specific job. Here are a few examples:

[Phing] can control your packaging, deployment or testing process from within a XML build file. Phing (which is based on [Apache Ant]) provides a rich set of tasks usually needed to install or update a web application and can be extended with additional custom tasks, written in PHP. It's a solid and robust tool and has been around for a long time, however the tool could be perceived as a bit old fashioned because of the way it deals with configuration (XML files).

[Capistrano] is a system for *intermediate-to-advanced programmers* to execute commands in a structured, repeatable way on one or more remote machines. It is pre-configured for deploying Ruby on Rails applications, however you can successfully deploy PHP systems with it. Successful use of Capistrano depends on a working knowledge of Ruby and Rake.

[Ansistrano] is a couple of Ansible roles to easily manage the deployment process (deploy and rollback) for scripting applications such as PHP, Python and Ruby. It's an Ansible port for [Capistrano]. It's been used by quite a lot of PHP companies already.

[Rocketeer] gets its inspiration and philosophy from the Laravel framework. Its goal is to be fast, elegant and easy to use with smart defaults. It features multiple servers, multiple stages, atomic deploys and deployment can be performed in parallel. Everything in the tool can be hot swapped or extended, and everything is written in PHP.

[Deployer] is a deployment tool written in PHP. It's simple and functional. Features include running tasks in parallel, atomic deployment and keeping consistency between servers. Recipes of common tasks for Symfony, Laravel, Zend Framework and Yii are available. Younes Rafie's article  [Easy Deployment of PHP Applications with Deployer][phpdeploy_deployer] is a great tutorial for deploying your application with the tool.

[Magallanes] is another tool written in PHP with simple configuration done in YAML files. It has support for multiple servers and environments, atomic deployment, and has some built in tasks that you can leverage for common tools and frameworks.

### Server Provisioning

Managing and configuring servers can be a daunting task when faced with many servers. There are tools for dealing with this so you can automate your infrastructure to make sure you have the right servers and that they're configured properly. They often integrate with the larger cloud hosting providers (Amazon Web Services, Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc) for managing instances, which makes scaling an application a lot easier.

[Ansible] is a tool that manages your infrastructure through YAML files. It's simple to get started with and can manage complex and large scale applications. There is an API for managing cloud instances and it can manage them through a dynamic inventory using certain tools.

[Puppet] is a tool that has its own language and file types for managing servers and configurations. It can be used in a master/client setup or it can be used in a "master-less" mode. In the master/client mode the clients will poll the central master(s) for new configuration on set intervals and update itself if necessary. In the master-less mode you can push changes to your nodes.

[Chef] is a powerful Ruby based system integration framework that you can build your whole server environment or virtual boxes with. It integrates well with Amazon Web Services through their service called OpsWorks.

### Continuous Integration

> Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently,
> usually each person integrates at least daily — leading to multiple integrations per day. Many teams find that this
> approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more
> rapidly.

*-- Martin Fowler*

There are different ways to implement continuous integration for PHP. [Travis CI] has done a great job of
making continuous integration a reality even for small projects. Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration service
for the open source community. It is integrated with GitHub and offers first class support for many languages including
PHP.
